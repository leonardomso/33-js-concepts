You've learned the fundamentals. Now it's time to go deeper.

**Beyond 33** is an advanced extension of the original 33 JavaScript Concepts. These 29 additional concepts cover topics that experienced developers encounter in real-world applications — from memory management to browser APIs, from metaprogramming with Proxies to performance optimization patterns.

<Info>
**Prerequisites:** Before diving into Beyond 33, make sure you're comfortable with the [original 33 concepts](/getting-started/about). These advanced topics build directly on that foundation.
