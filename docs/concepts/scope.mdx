## Overview

The ECMAScript specification outlines three key types of scope:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Function Scope">
    Variables declared within a function using `var` are only accessible within that function. This scope isolates variables from being accessed outside of the function where they are declared.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Block Scope">
    Introduced with ES6, variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped. This means they are only accessible within the specific block `{}` in which they are defined, such as inside loops or conditionals.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lexical Scope">
    Refers to how variable access is determined based on the physical location of the variables in the code. Functions are lexically scoped, meaning that they can access variables from their parent scope.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
