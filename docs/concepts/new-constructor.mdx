## Overview

The `new` operator creates an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types. When you use `new`, JavaScript creates a new empty object, sets the prototype, binds `this` to the new object, and returns the object.

<Info>
The `instanceof` operator tests whether the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object. This is useful for checking if an object was created by a particular constructor.
