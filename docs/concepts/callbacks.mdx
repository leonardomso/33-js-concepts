## Overview

A **callback** is a function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed later — either synchronously or asynchronously. Callbacks are the foundation of asynchronous JavaScript: event handlers, timers, and Node.js APIs all rely on this pattern.

<Warning>
**Prerequisites:** Before diving into async JavaScript, make sure you understand [the Event Loop](/concepts/event-loop) — it's the mechanism that makes all async code work! The Event Loop explains *how* JavaScript handles async operations; callbacks are *what* gets executed when those operations complete.
</Warning>

**What you'll learn in this guide:**
- What callbacks are and why JavaScript uses them
- Synchronous vs asynchronous callbacks
- The error-first callback pattern (Node.js convention)
- Callback hell and the "pyramid of doom"
- Why Promises were invented to solve callback problems
