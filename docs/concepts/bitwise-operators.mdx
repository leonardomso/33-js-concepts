## Overview

Bitwise operators treat their operands as a sequence of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. While not commonly used in everyday JavaScript programming, they are essential for certain low-level operations, performance optimizations, and working with binary data through TypedArrays and ArrayBuffers.
