## Overview

According to the ECMAScript specification, JavaScript includes both strict (`===`) and loose (`==`) equality operators, which behave differently when comparing values.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="== (Loose Equality)">
    This operator performs type coercion before comparing two values. If the values are of different types, JavaScript will attempt to convert one or both values to a common type before comparison, which can lead to unexpected results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="=== (Strict Equality)">
    This operator compares both the value and the type without any type coercion. If the two values are not of the same type, the comparison will return false.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="typeof Operator">
    The `typeof` operator is used to check the data type of a variable. While it's generally reliable, there are certain quirks, like how `typeof null` returns "object" instead of "null", due to a long-standing behavior in JavaScript's implementation.
