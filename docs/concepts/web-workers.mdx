description: "Learn Web Workers in JavaScript — run scripts in background threads for parallel execution. Master dedicated workers, shared workers, and off-main-thread processing for better performance."
---

## Overview

**Web Workers** allow JavaScript to run scripts in background threads, separate from the main execution thread. This enables parallel processing without blocking the UI, making them essential for CPU-intensive tasks like data processing, image manipulation, and complex calculations.

<Info>
**What you'll learn in this guide:**
- Why JavaScript needs Web Workers (single-threaded limitations)
- Creating and communicating with workers (`postMessage`, `onmessage`)
- Dedicated Workers vs Shared Workers vs Service Workers
- Transferable objects for efficient data transfer
- Worker limitations (no DOM access, different global scope)
- Use cases: heavy computations, data parsing, image processing
- Worker pools and performance patterns
- Comlink and other worker libraries
</Info>

<Warning>
**Prerequisites:** This guide builds on your understanding of [the Event Loop](/concepts/event-loop) and [async JavaScript](/concepts/async-await). Web Workers provide true parallelism, unlike async code which is still single-threaded.
