## Choose Your Path

Not everyone starts from the same place. Choose a learning path that matches your experience and goals.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Beginner">
    **For:** Complete beginners or those new to JavaScript
    
    **Time:** 4-8 weeks at a comfortable pace
    
    Start here if you're new to programming or just starting with JavaScript.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Intermediate">
    **For:** Developers with some JavaScript experience
    
    **Time:** 2-4 weeks
    
    Choose this if you can write basic JavaScript but want to understand it more deeply.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Interview Prep">
    **For:** Preparing for technical interviews
    
    **Time:** 1-2 weeks (review mode)

## Beginner Path

If you're new to JavaScript, follow this order. Each concept builds on the previous ones.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Week 1-2: The Fundamentals">
    Start with the building blocks of JavaScript.
    
    1. [Primitive Types](/concepts/primitive-types) - What types of data exist in JavaScript?
    2. [Value vs Reference Types](/concepts/value-reference-types) - How is data stored and copied?
    3. [Type Coercion](/concepts/type-coercion) - How JavaScript converts between types
    4. [Equality Operators](/concepts/equality-operators) - The difference between == and ===
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Week 3-4: Scope and Functions">
    Understand how JavaScript organizes and executes code.
    
    5. [Scope and Closures](/concepts/scope-and-closures) - Where variables are accessible
    6. [Call Stack](/concepts/call-stack) - How JavaScript tracks function calls
    7. [Event Loop](/concepts/event-loop) - How async code works
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Week 5-6: Working with Data">
    Learn to transform and manipulate data.
    
    8. [Higher-Order Functions](/concepts/higher-order-functions) - Functions that work with functions
    9. [map, reduce, filter](/concepts/map-reduce-filter) - Essential array methods
    10. [Pure Functions](/concepts/pure-functions) - Writing predictable code
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Week 7-8: Async JavaScript">
    Handle operations that take time.
    
    11. [Callbacks](/concepts/callbacks) - The original async pattern
    12. [Promises](/concepts/promises) - Modern async handling
    13. [async/await](/concepts/async-await) - Clean async syntax
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Take your time.** There's no rush. If a concept doesn't click, spend more time on it before moving on. Revisit the resources, try different explanations, and practice with code.
</Info>

## Intermediate Path

You know JavaScript basics. Now deepen your understanding with these concepts:

<Steps>
  <Step title="How JavaScript Works">
    Understand what's happening under the hood.
    
    1. [Call Stack](/concepts/call-stack) - How function execution is tracked
    2. [Event Loop](/concepts/event-loop) - The concurrency model
    3. [JavaScript Engines](/concepts/javascript-engines) - V8 and how code runs
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Object-Oriented JavaScript">
    Master objects and prototypes.
    
    4. [this, call, apply, bind](/concepts/this-call-apply-bind) - Context binding
    5. [Object Creation and Prototypes](/concepts/object-creation-prototypes) - The prototype chain
    6. [Factories and Classes](/concepts/factories-classes) - Object creation patterns
    7. [Inheritance and Polymorphism](/concepts/inheritance-polymorphism) - OOP in JavaScript
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Functional Programming">
    Write cleaner, more predictable code.
    
    8. [Pure Functions](/concepts/pure-functions) - Side-effect free functions
    9. [Higher-Order Functions](/concepts/higher-order-functions) - Functions as values
    10. [Currying and Composition](/concepts/currying-composition) - Advanced patterns
    11. [Recursion](/concepts/recursion) - Functions that call themselves
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Advanced Patterns">
    Level up your code quality.
    
    12. [Design Patterns](/concepts/design-patterns) - Proven solutions
    13. [Error Handling](/concepts/error-handling) - Graceful failure
    14. [Clean Code](/concepts/clean-code) - Writing maintainable code
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Interview Prep Path

Technical interviews often focus on these concepts. Make sure you can explain them clearly and write code examples.

### Must-Know Concepts

These come up in almost every JavaScript interview:

| Concept | Why It's Asked | Key Things to Know |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| [Closures](/concepts/scope-and-closures) | Tests fundamental understanding | How inner functions access outer variables |
| [this keyword](/concepts/this-call-apply-bind) | Common source of bugs | The four binding rules |
| [Promises](/concepts/promises) | Essential for async code | Chaining, error handling, Promise.all |
| [Event Loop](/concepts/event-loop) | Shows deep understanding | Call stack, task queue, microtasks |
| [Prototypes](/concepts/object-creation-prototypes) | JavaScript's inheritance | Prototype chain, Object.create |
