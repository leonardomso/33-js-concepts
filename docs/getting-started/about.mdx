## The Origin Story

In 2017, Stephen Curtis wrote an article titled ["33 Fundamentals Every JavaScript Developer Should Know"](https://medium.com/@stephenthecurt/33-fundamentals-every-javascript-developer-should-know-13dd720a90d1). It outlined the core concepts that separate developers who *use* JavaScript from developers who truly *understand* it.

[Leonardo Maldonado](https://github.com/leonardomso) took this idea and built something bigger: a curated collection of the best resources for each concept. What started as a personal learning project became one of the most popular JavaScript repositories on GitHub.

<Tip>
**Recognition:** GitHub featured this project as one of the [top open source projects of 2018](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/new-open-source-projects/#top-projects-of-2018).

## Who Is This For?

This guide is for anyone who wants to learn JavaScript, regardless of your current level.

| If you are... | This guide will help you... |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| **A complete beginner** | Build a solid foundation from the ground up |
| **Self-taught** | Fill gaps in your knowledge |
| **Preparing for interviews** | Understand concepts interviewers commonly ask about |
| **An experienced developer** | Deepen your understanding of how JavaScript works |

There are no prerequisites. If you've never written a line of code, you can start here.

## The Original 33 Concepts

These are the original 33 concepts that inspired this project. We've since reorganized and expanded some topics, but this is the foundation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fundamentals (Concepts 1-6)">
    1. **Call Stack** - How JavaScript tracks function execution
    2. **Primitive Types** - String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt
    3. **Value Types vs Reference Types** - How data is stored and passed
    4. **Type Coercion** - Implicit and explicit type conversion
    5. **Equality Operators** - == vs === and how comparisons work
    6. **Scope and Closures** - Where variables are accessible and how functions remember their environment
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Functions & Execution (Concepts 7-10)">
    7. **Expression vs Statement** - Understanding the difference
    8. **IIFE, Modules, and Namespaces** - Code organization patterns
    9. **Message Queue and Event Loop** - JavaScript's concurrency model
    10. **Timers** - setTimeout, setInterval, and requestAnimationFrame
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="JavaScript Engines (Concepts 11-13)">
    11. **JavaScript Engines** - V8, SpiderMonkey, and how JS runs
    12. **Bitwise Operators** - Low-level operations and typed arrays
    13. **DOM and Layout Trees** - How browsers render pages
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Object-Oriented JavaScript (Concepts 14-18)">
    14. **Factories and Classes** - Object creation patterns
    15. **this, call, apply, and bind** - Context and function binding
    16. **new, Constructor, instanceof** - Object instantiation
    17. **Prototype Inheritance** - JavaScript's inheritance model
    18. **Object.create and Object.assign** - Object manipulation methods
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Functional Programming (Concepts 19-23)">
    19. **map, reduce, filter** - Array transformation methods
    20. **Pure Functions and Side Effects** - Functional programming basics
    21. **Closures** - Functions that remember their scope
    22. **Higher-Order Functions** - Functions that operate on functions
    23. **Recursion** - Functions that call themselves
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Async JavaScript (Concepts 24-26)">
    24. **Collections and Generators** - Iterables and lazy evaluation
    25. **Promises** - Handling asynchronous operations
    26. **async/await** - Modern async syntax
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Advanced Topics (Concepts 27-33)">
    27. **Data Structures** - Arrays, Objects, Maps, Sets, and more
    28. **Big O Notation** - Algorithm complexity analysis
    29. **Algorithms** - Common algorithms in JavaScript
    30. **Inheritance and Polymorphism** - OOP principles
    31. **Design Patterns** - Proven solutions to common problems
    32. **Currying and Composition** - Advanced functional techniques
    33. **Clean Code** - Writing maintainable JavaScript
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What We've Changed

JavaScript and web development have evolved since the original list was created. We've updated this guide to better reflect what modern developers need to know.

### Concepts We Added

| Concept | Why We Added It |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Callbacks** | Essential for understanding async JavaScript before diving into Promises |
| **HTTP and Fetch** | Every web developer needs to know how to make network requests |
| **Web Workers** | Important for performance and running code off the main thread |
| **Error Handling** | Critical for building reliable applications |
| **Regular Expressions** | A fundamental tool for text processing and validation |
| **Modern JS Syntax** | Destructuring, spread operator, and other ES6+ features are now standard |
| **ES Modules** | The official module system for JavaScript |

### Concepts We Removed or Merged

| Original Concept | What Happened |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Expression vs Statement** | Covered within other concept pages where relevant |
| **Timers** | Merged into the Event Loop concept |
| **Bitwise Operators** | Rarely used in day-to-day JavaScript development |
| **new, Constructor, instanceof** | Merged into Factories and Classes |
| **Object.create and Object.assign** | Merged into Object Creation and Prototypes |

<Info>
The goal isn't to have exactly 33 concepts. It's to give you the knowledge you need to truly understand JavaScript.

## What Makes This Guide Different?

### Learn the Concept, Then Go Deeper

Each concept page teaches you the topic directly with clear explanations and practical code examples. Once you understand the fundamentals, you'll find a curated list of articles, videos, and books to explore further.

### Curated Resources

Every resource is hand-picked from across the web. Instead of one perspective, you get the best explanations from multiple teachers and sources.

### Community-Driven

Hundreds of developers have contributed to this project. Resources are continuously reviewed, updated, and improved by the community.

### Multiple Formats

Everyone learns differently. Each concept includes:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Articles" icon="newspaper">
    In-depth written explanations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Videos" icon="video">
    Visual explanations and talks
  </Card>
  <Card title="Books" icon="book">
    Comprehensive deep-dives
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Available in 40+ Languages

Thanks to our community of translators, this guide is accessible to developers worldwide. Check out the [translations page](/translations) to find your language.
