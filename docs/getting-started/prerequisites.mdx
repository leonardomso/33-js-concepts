## What Do You Need to Learn JavaScript?

This guide is designed for everyone, including complete beginners. You don't need to know any programming language before starting.

All you need are a few free tools that you probably already have.

---

## Required: A Web Browser

JavaScript runs in every web browser. You can use any modern browser:

| Browser | DevTools Shortcut |
|---------|------------------|
| **Chrome** (recommended) | F12 or Cmd+Option+J (Mac) |
| **Firefox** | F12 or Cmd+Option+I (Mac) |
| **Safari** | Cmd+Option+C (enable in Preferences first) |
| **Edge** | F12 |

<Tip>
**We recommend Chrome** for learning. It has excellent developer tools and most tutorials use it for screenshots and examples.
</Tip>

### Using the Browser Console

The browser console is where you'll run JavaScript code. Here's how to open it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open any webpage">
    Even a blank tab works
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Developer Tools">
    Press **F12** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Option+J** (Mac)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the Console tab">
    This is your JavaScript playground
  </Step>
  <Step title="Type code and press Enter">
    Try typing `console.log("Hello!")` and press Enter
  </Step>
</Steps>

```javascript
// Type this in your console right now
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!")
// Output: Hello, JavaScript!

// Try some math
2 + 2
// Output: 4

// Create a variable
const name = "Your Name"
console.log(name)
// Output: Your Name
```

That's it. You're ready to learn JavaScript.

## Recommended: A Code Editor

While you can learn a lot in the browser console, a code editor makes writing longer code much easier.

## Optional: Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) lets you run JavaScript outside the browser, on your computer's command line.

**You don't need Node.js to learn from this guide.** Everything can be done in the browser.

However, if you want to:
- Run JavaScript files from your terminal
- Use JavaScript for backend development later
- Follow along with some advanced tutorials

Then install the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Checking if Node.js is Installed

Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) and type:

```bash
node --version
```

If you see a version number like `v20.10.0`, you're good to go.

---

## Your First JavaScript Code

Let's make sure everything works. Open your browser console and type:

```javascript
// Variables
const message = "I'm learning JavaScript!"
console.log(message)

// A simple function
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!"
}

console.log(greet("World"))
// Output: Hello, World!
```

If you see the output, congratulations! You're ready to start learning.
