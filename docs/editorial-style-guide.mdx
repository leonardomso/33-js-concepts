## Why This Guide Exists

33 JavaScript Concepts should read like a clear, trusted teacher.

This guide defines how we write concept pages so they stay:

- accurate and evidence-based
- easy to understand for beginners and intermediate developers
- consistent across all topics
- backed by tested examples in our tested files

If a contribution does not meet these standards, it is not ready to publish.

## Voice Standard: Clear Teacher

Write like an experienced engineer teaching one person at a time.

### Required voice rules

1. Explain directly. Do not hide key ideas behind buzzwords.
2. Use active voice and short sentences.
3. Define terms before using advanced nuance.
4. Prefer practical language over academic phrasing.
5. Lead with what the reader should understand, then add context.

### Avoid these patterns

- citation-led openings such as "According to..." when a direct statement is clearer
- filler transitions such as "Now let's discuss..."
- exaggerated claims without evidence

<Tip>
Strong rule: explain first, cite second.
</Tip>

## Intro Framework (MAPP)

Every concept page intro should follow **MAPP** in this order.

| Step | What to write | Length target |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **M - Moment** | A real JavaScript situation where this concept appears | 1-2 sentences |
| **A - Abstract** | Plain-language definition of the concept | 1 sentence |
| **P - Payoff** | Why this matters in production/debugging/interviews | 1 sentence |
| **P - Preview** | What the page will teach and what the reader can do after | 1 sentence |

### Example shape

```mdx
You click a button and the UI freezes while data loads.

The event loop is JavaScript's scheduling model for async work on a single thread.

Understanding it helps you debug timing bugs, avoid UI jank, and reason about Promise behavior.

In this page, you will learn task queues, microtasks vs macrotasks, and how to choose the right async pattern.
```

## Research and Validation Before Writing

Before writing or updating technical claims, validate them.

### Source priority (highest to lower)

1. Official specifications (ECMAScript, WHATWG, W3C, RFCs)
2. Official docs (MDN, Node.js docs, browser vendor docs)
3. Reputable implementation sources (V8 blog, web.dev, Can I Use)
4. Community resources (articles, talks) for explanation quality only

### Evidence rules

- Use at least **two independent sources** for non-trivial technical claims.
- For browser support or usage stats, include source and recency.
- If a claim is disputed or subtle, cite the spec or official docs.
- Do not add decorative citations just to sound authoritative.

### Fact-check checklist

- Is the claim still true in modern JavaScript runtimes?
- Does wording match current spec/documentation behavior?
- Is browser/runtime scope explicit (browser, Node.js, both)?
- Are caveats included where behavior differs?

---

## Code Example Standard: Tested Files Required

Every example added to a concept page must be verified in our tested files.

### Rule

If code appears in `docs/concepts/*.mdx` or `docs/beyond/concepts/*.mdx`, there must be a corresponding test in `tests/` that validates behavior.

### Mapping guidance

- Core concept pages map to topic folders under `tests/` (for example `tests/fundamentals/*`, `tests/functions-execution/*`, `tests/advanced-topics/*`).
- Beyond pages map to `tests/beyond/*` clusters.
- DOM/browser behavior uses `.dom.test.js` where needed.

### Required verification workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="1) Locate or create the matching test file">
    Add or update tests in the relevant topic folder under `tests/`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2) Validate the new example behavior">
    Run targeted tests first, then full suite if the change is broad.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3) Keep docs and tests in sync">
    If example output or behavior changes, update both docs and tests in the same PR.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Test commands

```bash
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

<Warning>
Untested examples should not be merged. "Looks correct" is not enough.
</Warning>

## Page Structure Standard

Use this default structure for concept pages:

1. Intro using MAPP
2. Core explanation (simple to advanced)
3. Runnable examples
4. Common mistakes/debug notes
5. FAQ (4-5 useful questions)
6. Key takeaways
7. References/resources

Keep one primary idea per section. If a section covers multiple ideas, split it.

---

## FAQ Quality Rules

FAQ exists to answer real learner questions, not to pad content.

### Good FAQ questions

- "When should I use X vs Y?"
- "Why does this fail in this case?"
- "How do I debug this behavior quickly?"

### Weak FAQ questions

- definitions already explained in the first section
- broad questions with vague answers
- duplicate questions with minor wording changes

Each answer should be direct, short, and actionable.

## Publish Readiness Checklist

Before merging content updates, confirm all items:

- [ ] Intro follows MAPP and explains importance clearly
- [ ] Technical claims validated with authoritative sources
- [ ] Citations are purposeful, not decorative
- [ ] Every added/changed example is covered in tested files under `tests/`
- [ ] Relevant tests pass locally
- [ ] FAQ questions are practical and non-duplicate
- [ ] Writing is concise, clear, and consistent with teacher voice

---

## Exception Policy

Exceptions are allowed only when documented in the PR description:

- experimental or runtime-specific behavior
- legacy behavior kept for historical context
- intentionally simplified examples for beginner onboarding

Each exception must explain why the standard rule was not applied and how risk was reduced.
