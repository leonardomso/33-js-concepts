## Welcome

Welcome to **33 JavaScript Concepts** - a comprehensive guide to mastering the fundamental and advanced concepts that every JavaScript developer should know.

This project was created by [Leonardo Maldonado](https://github.com/leonardomso) and has been contributed to by hundreds of developers worldwide. It has been translated into over 40 languages and was recognized by GitHub as one of the top open source projects of 2018.

## How to Use This Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start from the Beginning">
    The concepts are ordered from fundamental to advanced. If you're new to JavaScript, start with the **Fundamentals** section and work your way through.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Read the Overview">
    Each concept page starts with an overview explaining the core idea based on the ECMAScript specification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the Resources">
    Each concept includes curated articles, videos, and book recommendations. Choose the format that works best for your learning style.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Practice">
    Reading alone isn't enough. Practice implementing these concepts in your own projects or coding exercises.
  </Step>
</Steps>
