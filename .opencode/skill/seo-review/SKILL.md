# Skill: SEO Audit for Concept Pages

Use this skill to perform a focused SEO audit on concept documentation pages for the 33 JavaScript Concepts project. The goal is to maximize search visibility for JavaScript developers.

## When to Use

- Before publishing a new concept page
- When optimizing underperforming pages
- Periodic content audits
- After major content updates
- When targeting new keywords

## Goal

Each concept page should rank for searches like:
- "what is [concept] in JavaScript"
- "how does [concept] work in JavaScript"
- "[concept] JavaScript explained"
- "[concept] JavaScript tutorial"
- "[concept] JavaScript example"

---

## SEO Audit Methodology

Follow these five steps for a complete SEO audit.

### Step 1: Identify Target Keywords

Before auditing, identify the keyword cluster for the concept.

#### Keyword Cluster Template

| Type | Pattern | Example (Closures) |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Primary** | [concept] JavaScript | closures JavaScript |
| **What is** | what is [concept] in JavaScript | what is a closure in JavaScript |
| **How does** | how does [concept] work | how do closures work |
| **How to** | how to use/create [concept] | how to use closures |
| **Why** | why use [concept] | why use closures JavaScript |
| **Examples** | [concept] examples | closure examples JavaScript |
| **vs** | [concept] vs [related] | closures vs scope |
| **Interview** | [concept] interview questions | closure interview questions |

### Step 2: On-Page SEO Audit

Check all on-page SEO elements systematically.

### Step 3: Featured Snippet Optimization

Verify content is structured to win featured snippets.

### Step 4: Internal Linking Audit

Check the internal link structure.

### Step 5: Generate Report

Document findings using the report template.

**Definition Paragraph Example (40-60 words):**

```markdown
## What is a Closure in JavaScript?

A **closure** is a function that retains access to variables from its outer 
(enclosing) scope, even after that outer function has finished executing. 
Closures are created every time a function is created in JavaScript, allowing 
inner functions to "remember" and access their lexical environment.
```

(This is 52 words - perfect for a featured snippet)

### Internal Linking Checklist (4 points)

| # | Check | Points | How to Verify |
|---|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | 3-5 related concepts linked in body | 1 | Count `/concepts/` links in prose |
| 2 | Descriptive anchor text | 1 | No "click here", "here", "this" |
| 3 | Prerequisites in Warning box | 1 | `<Warning>` with links at start |
| 4 | Related Concepts section has 4 cards | 1 | `<CardGroup>` at end with 4 Cards |

**Good Anchor Text:**

| ❌ Bad | ✓ Good |
|--------|--------|
| "click here" | "event loop concept" |
| "here" | "JavaScript closures" |
| "this article" | "our Promises guide" |
| "read more" | "understanding the call stack" |

**Link Placement Strategy:**

```markdown
<!-- In Prerequisites (Warning box) -->
<Warning>
**Prerequisite:** This guide assumes you understand [Promises](/concepts/promises) 
and the [Event Loop](/concepts/event-loop). Read those first if needed.
</Warning>

<!-- In Body Content (natural context) -->
When the callback finishes, it's added to the task queue — managed by 
the [event loop](/concepts/event-loop).

<!-- In Related Concepts Section -->
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Promises" icon="handshake" href="/concepts/promises">
    async/await is built on top of Promises
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
```

### Technical SEO Checklist (3 points)

| # | Check | Points | How to Verify |
|---|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Single H1 per page | 1 | Only one `#` heading (the title) |
| 2 | URL slug contains keyword | 1 | `/concepts/closures` not `/concepts/topic-1` |
| 3 | No orphan pages | 1 | Page is linked from at least one other page |

**H1 Rule:**

Every page should have exactly ONE H1 (your main title). This is critical for SEO:
- The H1 tells Google what the page is about
- Multiple H1s confuse search engines about page hierarchy
- All other headings should be H2 (`##`) and below
- The H1 should contain your primary keyword

```markdown
# Closures in JavaScript     ← This is your H1 (only one!)

## What is a Closure?        ← H2 for sections
### Lexical Scope            ← H3 for subsections
## How Closures Work         ← Another H2
```

**URL/Slug Best Practices:**

| ✅ Good | ❌ Bad |
|---------|--------|
| `/concepts/closures` | `/concepts/c1` |
| `/concepts/event-loop` | `/concepts/topic-7` |
| `/concepts/type-coercion` | `/concepts/abc123` |
| `/concepts/async-await` | `/concepts/async_await` |

Rules for slugs:
- **Include primary keyword** — The concept name should be in the URL
- **Use hyphens, not underscores** — `event-loop` not `event_loop`
- **Keep slugs short and readable** — Under 50 characters
- **No UUIDs, database IDs, or random strings**
- **Lowercase only** — `/concepts/Event-Loop` should be `/concepts/event-loop`

**Orphan Page Detection:**

An orphan page has no internal links pointing to it from other pages. This hurts SEO because:
- Google may not discover or crawl it frequently
- It signals the page isn't important to your site structure
- Users can't navigate to it naturally
- Link equity doesn't flow to the page

**How to check for orphan pages:**
1. Search the codebase for links to this concept: `grep -r "/concepts/[slug]" docs/`
2. Verify it appears in at least one other concept's "Related Concepts" section
3. Check that pages listing it as a prerequisite link back appropriately
4. Ensure it's included in the navigation (`docs.json`)

**Fixing orphan pages:**
- Add the concept to related pages' "Related Concepts" CardGroup
- Link to it naturally in body content of related concepts
- Ensure bidirectional linking (if A links to B, B should link back to A where relevant)

## Summary

When auditing a concept page for SEO:

1. **Identify target keywords** using the keyword cluster for that concept
2. **Check title tag** — 50-60 chars, keyword first, hook, ends with "JavaScript"
3. **Check meta description** — 150-160 chars, action word, keyword, specific value
4. **Verify keyword placement** — Title, description, first 100 words, H2
5. **Audit content structure** — Question hook, early code, Info box, short paragraphs
6. **Optimize for featured snippets** — 40-60 word definitions, numbered steps, tables
7. **Check internal linking** — 3-5 links, good anchors, Related Concepts section
8. **Generate report** — Document score, issues, and prioritized fixes

**Remember:** SEO isn't about gaming search engines — it's about making content easy to find for developers who need it. Every optimization should also improve the reader experience.
