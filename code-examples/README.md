# JavaScript Concept Code Examples

This directory contains practical code examples for the 33 JavaScript concepts every developer should know. These examples are designed to help you understand and practice each concept with hands-on code.

## Purpose

The main repository provides comprehensive explanations of JavaScript concepts with articles and videos. This directory supplements that content by providing:

- Practical code examples for each concept
- Interactive demonstrations of JavaScript behavior
- Clear explanations of complex concepts through code
- Reference implementations for learning

## Available Examples

- `call-stack-example.js` - Demonstrates how the JavaScript call stack works
- `primitive-types-example.js` - Shows examples of JavaScript's primitive data types
- `value-reference-types-example.js` - Illustrates the difference between value and reference types
- `implicit-explicit-typing-example.js` - Shows implicit and explicit type coercion in JavaScript

## How to Use

Run any example file with Node.js:

```bash
node code-examples/call-stack-example.js
```

Each file is self-contained and includes detailed comments explaining the concepts being demonstrated.

## Contributing

Feel free to add more examples for the remaining concepts:

1. Create a new file following the naming pattern: `{concept-name}-example.js`
2. Include detailed comments explaining the concept
3. Provide practical examples that demonstrate the concept in action
4. Test your example with Node.js before submitting a PR
