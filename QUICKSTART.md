Get started with the 33 JavaScript concepts templates in minutes! 🚀

## What You'll Learn

This repository helps you master 33 fundamental JavaScript concepts through hands-on practice with ready-to-use templates.

## Getting Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Clone or Download

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/QTechDevelopment/33-js-concepts.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd 33-js-concepts
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Starting Point

**New to JavaScript?** Start with Concept 1:
```bash
cd templates
node 01-call-stack.js
```

**Want to practice a specific concept?** Pick from the list:
- `01-call-stack.js` - Understanding function execution
- `02-primitive-types.js` - JavaScript data types
- `06-scope.js` - Variable scope and closures
- `21-closures.js` - Advanced closure patterns
- `25-promises.js` - Async programming
- ... and 28 more!

### Step 3: Start Learning

Open any template in your favorite editor and:

1. **Read** the concept explanation at the top
2. **Study** the examples provided
3. **Complete** the practice exercises (marked with `// TODO:`)
4. **Experiment** by modifying the code
5. **Run** your changes: `node <filename>.js`

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Copy a template to work on
cp templates/01-call-stack.js my-practice.js

# Edit it in your editor
code my-practice.js  # or vim, nano, etc.

# Run it
node my-practice.js

# Experiment and learn!
```

## What's in Each Template?

Every template includes:

✅ **Clear Explanation** - What the concept is and why it matters  
✅ **Multiple Examples** - From basic to advanced usage  
✅ **Practice Exercises** - Hands-on coding challenges  
✅ **Common Pitfalls** - Mistakes to avoid  
✅ **Best Practices** - How to use the concept correctly  
✅ **Notes & Tips** - Key takeaways
